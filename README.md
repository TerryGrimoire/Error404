# ⛔ ERROR 404 ⛔

First project in group - Wild Code School : 
We had 2 weeks to create a fully responsive website using mostly HTML and CSS. We also added some vanilla JavaScript but the main goal of this project was to train on HTML and CSS. 

After noticing that we no longer found the error 404 when navigating online, we decided to create a website to save the ERROR 404. The ERRROR 404 : Page not found, is part of the geek culture but also part of the web history. As developers, we must preserve those things and that's the reason why we started this project.
